# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-Java
This course improved my ability to solve complex problems by introducing me to classical algorithms and problems. I achieved the highest possible grade in this course and have included the assignments in this repo. The course helped me to foster an appreciation for well-written code. It also helped me to think like a computer scientist and gave me the skills to carry out runtime and memory trade-offs when solving complex problems.
